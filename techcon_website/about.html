                    TechCon's origins trace back to 1995, when it began as a modest,
                    highly specialized "Protocol and Network Symposium" dedicated to
                    foundational internet principles, characterized by deep technical
                    discussions among network engineers and academic researchers . By
                    the turn of the millennium, the event successfully rebranded as
                    TechCon, reflecting a strategic pivot toward the commercialization
                    of the internet with focuses on e-commerce security and the rise of
                    mobile computing.
